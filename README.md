What is Quorum? 

Quorum is an Ethereum-based distributed ledger protocol that has been developed to provide industries such as finance, supply chain, retail, real estate, etc. with a permissioned implementation of Ethereum that supports transaction and contract privacy. 

Quorum includes a minimalistic fork of the Go Ethereum client (a.k.a geth), and as such, leverages the work that the Ethereum developer community has undertaken. 

The primary features of Quorum, and therefore extensions over public Ethereum, are: 

-Transaction and contract privacy 

-Multiple voting-based consensus mechanisms 

-Network/Peer permissions management 

-Higher performance 

Quorum currently includes the following components: 

-Quorum Node (modified Geth Client) 

-Privacy Manager (Constellation/Tessera) 

  -Transaction Manager 

  -Enclave
